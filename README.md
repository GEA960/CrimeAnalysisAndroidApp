# CrimeAnalysisAndroidApp
This project is a GIS based Android application for crime analysis.

The objective of this project is to provide a crime analysis tool for the users using which they could gather information about the crimes that have occurred in their vicinity and determine the distance from them. Users can query the feature service to filter different crime types and display them on a base-map. The application also makes use of the geocoding services to locate an address provided by the user. GPS based location services are used to determine the current location of the user. The measuring tool feature provided by the application can be used to determine distance and area among crime locations. This project makes use of ESRI's ArcGIS based web services.
